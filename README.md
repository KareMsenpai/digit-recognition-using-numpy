This is my first AI/ML project which is made  using only numpy and mathematics this code is inspired by the video by Samson-Zhang on building a neural-network from scratch

The accuracy of MY model was about 90%

The runtime was about 100 sec
Will try to improve the algorithm bby adding more layers
